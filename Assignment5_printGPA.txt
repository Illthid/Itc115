/*
 * Write a method called printGPA that accepts a Scanner for the console
as a parameter and calculates a student's grade point average. The user
will type a line of input containing the student's name, then a number
that represents the number of scores, followed by that many integer
scores. Here are two example dialogues:
Enter a student record: Maria 5 72 91 84 89 78
Maria's grade is 82.8
Enter a student record: Jordan 4 86 71 62 90
Jordan's grade is 77.25
Maria's grade is 82.8 because her average of (72 + 91 + 84 + 89 +78) / 5 equals 82.8.
