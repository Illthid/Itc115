/*
Season
This method takes two integers as parameters representing
a month and day and that returns a String indicating the season for that month
and day. Assume that months are specified as an integer between 1 and 12 (1 for
January, 2 for February, and so on) and that the day of the month is a number
between 1 and 31.
If the date falls between 12/16 and 3/15, you should return "Winter". If the
date falls between 3/16 and 6/15, you should return "Spring". If the date falls
between 6/16 and 9/15, you should return "Summer". And if the date falls between
9/16 and 12/15, you should return "Fall".
